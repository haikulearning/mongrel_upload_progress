v0.2.4. Changed the way UploadProgressConfig behaves. It now looks for a single mongrel_upload_progress.yml file with multiple environment configs set inside (much like database.yml in Rails). It also raises a NoConfigSpecified error if config there's a
problem loading the relevant configuration.

v0.2.3. Haiku Learning Systems modifications. The path_info Array now matches using === allowing for Regexp and other creative path matchers. Adding UploadProgressConfig to support different configurations for different environments.

v0.2.2. Signed gem.
